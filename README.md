Script to insert a single or multiple blocks at multiple points in Rhino. 
There are two versions:

1. "blocks to points for a single layer of points."
   -this selects a random block from a list of blocks then rotates and scales it to specified values 
3. "blocks to points for multiple layers of points."
   -this one selects a random block from a list of blocks and rotates the block at a fixed 90Â° intervals

Each version comes with a sample Rhino file to test workability.
